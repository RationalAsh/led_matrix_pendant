LED Matrix Pendant
===================

This year I'm making yet another cool electronic birthday gift
for my SO. I decided to work with one of those really cool looking
LED matrix displays this time. I still haven't decided what I'm
going to make the lED matrix do. Right now I'm leaning towards a
simulation of John Conway's Game of Life. But that might change in
the future. The project is done using an Arduino because that makes
things simpler and I'm using the MAX7219 library that's available
